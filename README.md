# Google Apps Script — 100 Advanced Examples

A GitHub-ready pack of **100 advanced Google Apps Script examples**, organized into numbered folders.

Each example includes:
- `README.md` (what it does + notes)
- `Code.gs` (copy/paste working code)

## Notes
- Some examples require **Advanced Google Services** (e.g., Drive API, Admin SDK, BigQuery). Those examples are labeled.
- Replace placeholders like `PASTE_FOLDER_ID`, `PASTE_DOC_ID`, etc.
- Web App examples (`doGet`/`doPost`) must be deployed: **Deploy → New deployment → Web app**.
